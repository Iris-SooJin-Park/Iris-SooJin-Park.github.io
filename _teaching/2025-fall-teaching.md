This course provides an introduction to experimental and causal methods for driving business insights. In this course you will gain an understanding of how to design randomized-controlled experiments and how to analyze and present the data from those experiments. This course will also highlight that even when organizations do not conduct explicit randomized experiments, there are often versions of “natural experiments” that can be leveraged from business data. Through this course you will develop the experimental mindset needed to identify these opportunities and some important data analysis techniques for establishing causal relationships from existing data in business environments.
